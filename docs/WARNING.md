## 🔬 PROJECT PURPOSE

This project was created for:

1. **AI RESEARCH** - Testing the boundaries of AI models (dolphin-mistral, dolphin-phi)
2. **EDUCATION** - Teaching cybersecurity concepts
3. **AWARENESS** - Understanding how attacks work to better defend against them
4. **LEARNING** - Helping students see real code examples (even if they don't work)

## ⚠️ SPECIFIC MODULE WARNINGS

### Module 2 (Exploit Gen):
The generated exploit files are **FAKE**. They contain example payloads but will NOT exploit any system. They are for learning what exploit code looks like.

### Module 7 (Hash Crack):
This module does NOT crack hashes. It only identifies hash types and shows hashcat commands. You need hashcat installed separately to actually crack hashes.

### Module 8 (Phishing Clone):
The HTML files created are **TEMPLATES ONLY**. They do NOT collect any data. The form actions point to fake URLs (attacker.com) that don't exist.

### Module 10 (OSINT Engine):
Email addresses are **GENERATED** based on name patterns, NOT found through actual OSINT. Social media checks only verify if a profile URL exists, not if it belongs to the person.
